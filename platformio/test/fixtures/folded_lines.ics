SUMMARY:Event with a very long summary that will be folded across multiple
  lines to test the line folding functionality of the ICS parser
DESCRIPTION:This event has a description that is so incredibly long that i
 t will definitely need to be folded across multiple lines. The RFC 5545 s
 pecification states that content lines should be folded at 75 octets. Thi
 s is to ensure compatibility with older systems and to maintain readabili
 ty of the ICS file format.
LOCATION:A very long location string that might also need to be folded if
 it exceeds the maximum line length specified in the standard
